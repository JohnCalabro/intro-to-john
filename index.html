        <p>Hey, my name is John Calabro. As a student of Flatiron, I am working to hone my skills as a developer.</p>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>When I knew nothing about coding, it was easy for me to assume
            a coding project was some sort of math problem. But when I started
        learning the fundamentals, I quickly discovered that programming is about problem solving
        and about being creative.
    I have always loved building things, when I'm not learning to code, 
 I like to write. Like with coding, I follow a process that involves building
something from the ground up, in the case of writing, I build a story.
But before I can craft a complete narrative, I need to do research about
what I am writing, the next step is world building. Then I develop a set
of characters who possess meaningful motivations, and then set up 
challenges my characters face within the world I built from scratch.
The prospect of being able to implement a completely new creative
process, in order to build software and web content from the
ground up excites me. My name is John Calabro, and I would
like to share my personal journey with you.   </p>
